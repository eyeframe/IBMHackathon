## PROJECT OVERVIEW :
![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46212400-8112e080-c353-11e8-9e5b-1a63c131a34a.PNG)

## FUNCTIONING OF THE WEBSITE:

OVERALL VIEW OF OUR UI AND WEBSITE

showcasing usability and services provided on the site

![g1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46307486-ac583280-c5d4-11e8-852d-51e98adaa379.gif)

We use IBM's weather API to get current weather information and forcasted weather information for three days

![g2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46307510-bda13f00-c5d4-11e8-9a89-83a7e6cecf0c.gif)

We can switch between the dashboard and the main website 

![g6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46309350-bb8daf00-c5d9-11e8-8ee3-ddc426734fdd.gif)

Here you can view buildings with different levels of risks (more information regarding the prediction algorithm can be found below in 'PREDICTING BUILDING DAMAGE' section)

![g3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46307522-c560e380-c5d4-11e8-9fb1-07bb6618f6b4.gif)

After getting the invite and registering , you can use the following link to access the slack group

## PREDICTING BUILDING DAMAGE :

[link to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/Earthquake_building_damage_prediction.ipynb)

In this jupyter notebook we try to predict the damage of buildings in case of an earthquake based on features 
such as Superstructure type, Age, Area etc

Marking the buildings in an area based on the damage it may suffer in case of an earthquake

## FLOOD ANOMALY DETECTION :
[link to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/flood_anomaly_detection.ipynb)

We are using a reservoir water levels to stimulate a water body where flooding is possible
We are plotting the anomalies on elevation vs index graph (red dots represent anomaly)

![capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46212409-8839ee80-c353-11e8-9a10-7353061730aa.PNG)

sending notifications once the anomalies are detected so that proper actions could be taken

## POPUALTION INFLUX AND OUTFLUX ANOMALY :
[link to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/food_resource_management.ipynb)

Plotting anomaly of incoming and outgoing people per day .
Using this we calculate the food stocks needed in order to fullfil the needs for the population residing in the 
affected area

incoming population and anomalies(red dots represent anomaly)

outgoing population and anomalies(red dots represent anomaly)

## FOOD RESOURCE MANAGEMENT :
[link to jupyter notebook](https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon/blob/master/jupyter_notebooks/food_resource_management.ipynb)

informing about the current stocks remaining , how many days it will last and if the condition is critical or not
based on the no of days left for disaster

![g4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37112252/46307527-c85bd400-c5d4-11e8-9427-03555c570369.gif)

Press the arrow on the bottom right corner to bring the inventory menu up

## INSTALL DOCKER :
●	Install a maintained version of Docker Community Edition (CE) or Enterprise Edition (EE) on a supported platform.

https://www.docker.com/products/docker-engine

![alt text](https://s3-torquehhvm-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/uploads/2016/08/docker-version.png)

●	Run the following lines on a command prompt : 

1.	`sudo docker pull eyeframe/callforcodeorg`
2.	`sudo docker run -p 8081:8081 -it --device /dev/snd  eyeframe/callforcodeorg`

if the docker pull dosen't work , follow these steps 
1. `sudo docker build -t eyeframe/callforcode .`
2. `sudo docker run -p 8081:8081 -it --device /dev/snd  eyeframe/callforcode`

(it may take several minutes to get the docker container up and running)

## HOW TO RUN THE SERVER DIRECTLY :

clone the repository using

   `git clone https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon.git`
   
follow the instructions given below

•	Download anaconda and nodejs from these links

   https://www.anaconda.com/download/

   https://nodejs.org/en/download/

•	Open the anaconda prompt and use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the required libraries in one go 
   (requirements.txt is included in this folder) 

•	Open console and type `npm install` and then `npm start`

## IMPORTANT :

If the alerts are not getting marked down (in the maps widget), it may be due to our API keys getting exhausted 

In such a case create a new google account and obtain the new API key inorder to integrate it in 
our project files (sorry for any inconvenience caused)

for instructions on how to use slack and its various commands , view the link below

[Instructions](https://github.com/eyeframe/IBMHackathon/blob/master/instructions.txt)

(If the slack commands aren't working , it is due to the server running the slack API being down)
